	<title>Database drivers</title>

	<chapterinfo>
		<abstract>
			<para>
				DataCleaner ships with a set of standard database drivers,
				enabling you to connect to common databases such as PostgreSQL,
				MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.
			</para>
			<para>It's also not uncommon to wish to install additional drivers
				for other database brands. DataCleaner uses the JDBC standard for
				managing database drivers and connection. In this chapter we cover
				the process of installing additional database drivers.
