		<abstract>
			<para>In this chapter we look at the file and folder layout of a
				DataCleaner monitor repository. Beginning with the multi-tenant
				layout, and then proceeding with a typical tenant's repository

		<para>The DataCleaner repository layout, used by the monitoring web
			application, is built to support multi-tenant deployments. Therefore,
			on the root level of the repository, folders are located which each
			represent a tenant's separate home folder. Users from one tenant are
			not able to access files or folders from other tenant's home folders.
		</para>
		<para>By default the server is configured as a single-tenant instance.
			In the Enterprise Edition of DataCleaner this can be reconfigured in
			the following ways:</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Tenant per user: This provides a completely separated
					workspace for each user of the monitor server.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Manual user groups: A configuration where the tenants are
					manually configured using a list of usernames.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Dynamic tenant management: For customers we can provide
					dynamic tenant management modules that advice with e.g. LDAP
					systems to determine the tenant of any particular user.</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>

		<title>Tenant home layout</title>
		<para>To function properly, each tenant home folder requires these
			files and folders:
		</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>conf.xml (file)</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>jobs (folder)</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>results (folder)</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>timelines (folder)</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>
			The
			<emphasis>conf.xml</emphasis>
			file represents the DataCleaner configuration for the particular
			tenant. The file format is the same as described in the
			<link linkend="chapter_configuration_file">Configuration file</link>
			chapter. It is recommended to use the supplied example conf.xml file
			(for the 'DC' tenant) as a template for further customization.
			Specifically the custom elements for task-runner, descriptor-provider
			and storage-provider in this template conf.xml file is recommended
			for optimal performance.
		</para>
		<para>
			The folders are all
			<emphasis>managed</emphasis>
			by the DataCleaner monitoring web application, so only in rare cases
			should you manually interact with them.
		</para>
		<para>It is allowed to add more files and folders to the tenant home.
			These will not be managed by the monitor application, but can be
			referenced eg. as the filename paths of datastores defined in
			conf.xml.
		</para>
