		<title>Access denied or FileNotFoundException during file upload</title>

		<para>
			Have you experienced "Access denied" or "java.io.FileNotFoundException" during a file upload
			(for example a CSV datastore)? Problem can be in permissions that need to be changed. DataCleaner Monitor
			temporary upload directory is probably not writable. Typical situation
			like this can happen on Windows if you unzip your Apache Tomcat into "Program Files" folder.
		</para>

		<section>
			<title>Workaround</title>

			<para>
				You can fix this by using proper Windows installer for your Apache Tomcat and/or putting it
				somewhere else than "Program Files". Another approach might be a manual change of permissions 
				so that the temporary file upload folder is writable.
